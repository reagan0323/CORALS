Generalized Coclustering Analysis of Non-Gaussian Tensor Arrays
The main functions are 
(1) GBC.m   generalized biclustering analysis for matrix data (continuous, binary, count-valued) 
(2) GCC.m   generalized coclustering analysis for tensor arrays (continuous, binary, count-valued)

For testing coclustering, run Simulation_Analysis.m

For testing rank selection performance of the method, run Simulation_Analysis - rank.m

For replicating the real data analyses in the paper, run RealData_Analysis.m
